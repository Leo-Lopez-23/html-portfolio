<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Leomar Lopez and Im from Harrisonburg Virginia. Grew up loving video games and computers. I graduated highschool in 2018 and went to VCU for Political Science though it only lasted a year. 
A 4 year school was something I wasn't interested at the time so I returned home. I continued my academic journey at Blue Ridge Community College and then COVID happened. So with a sense of wanting to do something.
I went ahead and accquired my real estate license. After a long strenuos journey getting that. I still wasnt fufilled. It wasnt until my friend was doing computer science and got a job making 6 figures.
I went into a self taught rabbit hole on youtube and saw that you can get a job in software development being self taught as long as you have the knowledge. I started with FreeCodeCamp and that is an amazing resource to begin.
I recieved my HTML and CSS certificate through them and started the JAVASCRIPT course they offered, but thats when it started to pick up and the concepts were becoming diifcult. So I decided to head over to Udemy and heard about Angela Yu
course complete web designer so I joined. It really helps with brushing the HTML and CSS I know and I am really looking forward to the JavaScript portion because I think someone explaining it to me will help alot.
